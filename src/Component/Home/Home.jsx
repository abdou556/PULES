            </div>Telehealth, also known as telemedicine, 
            is the use of technology to provide remote healthcare 
            services and consultations. A telehealth app allows 
            patients to connect with healthcare providers from the 
            comfort of their own homes or workplaces, using video 
            conferencing, messaging, or other communication methods. 
            Telehealth apps are becoming increasingly popular as they provide a 
            convenient way for patients to access healthcare services without having 
            to travel to a physical location, which is especially beneficial for 
            those who live in rural or remote areas, 
            or for those who have limited mobility or
             transportation options. Telehealth apps 
             can be used for a variety of healthcare services,
              such as virtual consultations, remote monitoring, 
              medication management, and mental health support. 
              They have the potential to improve patient outcomes,
               increase patient satisfaction, 
               and reduce healthcare costs by minimizing the
             need for in-person visits and hospitalizations.
